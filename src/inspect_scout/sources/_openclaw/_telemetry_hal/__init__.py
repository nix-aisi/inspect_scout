"""OpenClaw ``telemetry-hal`` importer.

Imports the JSONL telemetry written by the ``openclaw-telemetry-hal`` plugin
(https://github.com/sage-princeton/openclaw-telemetry-hal). These are **not**
native OpenClaw session files, which are an entirely different, richer schema
handled by a separate (future) importer. See the design doc
``design/openclaw-telemetry-hal.md`` for the schema analysis and known
limitations.
