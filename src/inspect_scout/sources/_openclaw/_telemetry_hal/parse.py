"""OpenClaw telemetry-hal parsing: raw events into a consolidated intermediate.

Why an intermediate (``OpenClawTelemetry``): the raw events can't be streamed
straight into Inspect events. ``agent.*`` re-dumps a cumulative ``messages[]``
and sub-agents span two export schemas, so the consolidation (deduping recurring
turns, reconstructing sub-agent spans) is *global* work over the whole file that
must finish before any mapping starts.

The format in brief
--------------------
JSONL, one event per line. Payload-bearing events:

- ``agent.start`` / ``agent.end`` carry a ``sessionKey`` and a CUMULATIVE
  ``messages[]`` snapshot (assistant turns, ``toolResult``s,
  ``compactionSummary``s). The same turn recurs across snapshots, so turns must
  be deduped by ``responseId`` — or, when the capture carries none, by
  ``(timestamp, content)`` with toolCall ids masked, because OpenClaw's history
  sanitizer rewrites those ids between a turn's first snapshot and all later
  ones (see :func:`_keyless_content_json`).
- ``tool.start`` / ``tool.end`` are individual tool calls (the only place
  schema-B sub-agent activity is recorded).
- ``sessionKey`` is ``agent:<...>:<kind>:<uuid>`` with ``kind`` one of ``main``,
  ``telegram``, ``dashboard`` (orchestrator surfaces) or ``subagent``
  (delegated work). Any other kind on a consumed event fails the import
  loudly rather than silently dropping that session's activity.

Intentionally NOT consumed: ``message.in`` / ``message.sending`` /
``message.out`` (channel I/O). A sub-agent's final report is auto-announced as a
``message.out`` on the orchestrator's outbound channel, but those events carry
no ``sessionKey``, ``runId``, or ``agentId`` (and the spawn result is only an
``accepted`` ack), so a report cannot be deterministically attributed to the
sub-agent that produced it — file order misleads (reports arrive in completion,
not spawn, order) and only the report text echoing the spawn ``label`` ties the
two together. We therefore do not surface sub-agent reports; see the design doc
``openclaw-telemetry-hal.md`` ("Known limitations").

The two sub-agent encodings come from OpenClaw, not the telemetry recorder (a
passive forwarder): schema B (activity in ``tool.*`` events) is near-universal,
since the tool hooks fire for every call; schema A (sub-agent turns in ``agent.*
messages[]``, with timestamps + usage) is the richer overlay OpenClaw adds only
when it populates a sub-agent's ``messages[]``. A session may carry A, B, or
both (hybrid); A is authoritative when present.
